# The standard MPI example, computes the integral

# Integrate[4/(1+x^2),{x,0,1}]

# numerically, and in parallel.
# To run:

python pypi.py

# A few warnings:
#  - Evaluating this integral is a horrible way to get the value of Pi
#  - Uniform sampling (or the trapezoidal rule, as implemented here) is
#    a horrible way to get the value of the integral
#
# For speed, use scipy instead, which provides the bindings to quadpack.
